## **Description**
Real estate data analysis challenge of the BeCode AI Bootcamp

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to establish itself as the biggest one in all of Belgium. To pursue this goal, it needs to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales. That way, they can pick out the properties that are the most valuable to them.

But for this, it needs to do a preliminary analysis to gather some information. Having no in-house data scientist, they are looking for talented people to do it for them.

Since your last encounter with them went great, they reached out to you to do this job. Everything is in your hands now!

Take the dataset previously scraped to do the analysis.
